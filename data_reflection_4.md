Predicting Elections with Data Science
 
As the 2020 election rapidly approaches, Americans around the country are increasingly impatient and want a correct prediction for who will win immediately. These predictions have become increasingly accurate recently due to advances in data science methods. The two data science methods that are used for forecasting the election are fundamentals based models and polls based models. The former uses “GDP growth, demographic data, and other fundamental data” to predict elections, while the latter uses “state and national polls to make predictions” (Bakthavachalam, 2019). At the beginning of an election cycle, poll-based models are not used often since they are not accurate because the election is so far away, and there are various confounding variables such as name recognition that would skew the results. Therefore, fundamentals based models are used more often at the beginning of the cycle, and polls based models become more prominent closer to election day.

However, one of the concerns when using fundamentals based models is that there is limited data since there have been few presidential elections in the grand scheme of things. Moreover, the party system has constantly evolved in the United States, and the modern version of our system has only been around since 1980, leaving little data to accurately predict the election cycle. Therefore, these models aren’t perfect for predicting the future since previous elections are given too much weight than they should be given.

The fundamentals based model utilizes a linear mixed model since it “allows us to easily simulate the election by adding in historical error to greatly reduce the overfitting problem” (Bakthavachalam, 2019). Using this model, Each state’s vote share in elections from 1980 to 2016 are denoted as Y, while a set of state-level features are denoted as X. The model is represented by the equation Y = (B * X) + National Error + Regional Error + State Error. In this model (B * X) represents the expected Democrat vote share in a specific state. The national errors in the model are factors that affect all states, such as national swings towards a political party due to national unpopularity. Regional errors are factors that affect certain regions, such as Southern states being more likely to vote Republican. State errors are factors that affect certain states, for example, California and New York vote very similarly in presidential elections. The errors are calculated using a t distribution where the variance stems from historical error. Overall, this model needs to be repeated multiple times, with different factors being used, and the model will compute a percent of the Democratic vote share, with one minus the result equalling the percent of the Republican vote share in the presidential election.

Interestingly, the fundamentals based model is mainly used in two time periods, the September, the previous year before the election (September 2019), and then right before the election (October 2020). In terms of its accuracy, the fundamentals based model has been correct in its September prediction every year from 1980 to 2012, with the exception of 2016. However, the model has been correct every year, including 2016, when using the October prediction. Based on the September prediction for 2020, the Republicans have been given a slight edge in winning the election. Recently, the October prediction has given the Democrats a bigger margin of victory over the Republicans. Overall, the model is approximately 90% accurate every year, averaging being wrong for five states every election cycle.
