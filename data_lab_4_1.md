The plot above depicts the country of Georgia and its population density depicted by a scale of colors, with the darker blues representing a higher population density, and the lighter blues representing a lower population density. Only Georgia's adm1 boundaries are shown.

# Plot of the logarithim of Georgia's Population Density

The plot above the depicts Georgia and the logarithim of its population density. The higher the log(density), the darker the blue, and vice versa. Georgia's adm2 boundaries are shown in this plot.
