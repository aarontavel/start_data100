Data Science Reflection

 

Data science, a relatively recent field of study, is used “as a medium for better understanding interactions of the simultaneously co-evolving agents that comprise complex adaptive, economic and social systems” (Frazier, 2020). Data science allows for the measurement of numerous variables to describe the human experience, and these measurements can then be applied to make conclusions from the collected data. In the past decade, due to data science, there have been “significant gains in our ability to describe, analyze, and predict human development processes” within the critical field of geospatial analytics (Frazier, 2020). Moreover, it is anticipated that data science will continue to be used for elevating the understanding of individual and community scale behavior of how consumers behave in the market, politics, the development of settlements, and responses to events that affect these settlements such as climate change. However, there are concerns that arise from data science that could harm society, such as the manipulation of your personal data by bad aactors. Overall, the advent of data science is serving to advance our understanding of complex adaptive, economic, and social systems since it can improve the human condition by allowing new technologies to better serve humanity.

As a result of the growing use of data science, more information can be collected on humans, such as personal consumption preferences, political views, or even as simple as a favorite genre of movie. As a result of this “big data” being collected on individuals, technology can be better fine-tuned to meet the needs of the individual. For example, a consumer that is relatively frugal, but needs to buy a new vacuum cleaner, can have the advertisements on their computer better reflect the consumption preferences of the individual. In addition, politicians and their campaigns can utilize big data by finding out the most likely voters for them during the election, as well as target demographics they should be reaching out to. This allows for a more direct approach from politicians to their constituents, as instead of addressing every member of your congressional district in a wide-ranging TV address, a politician’s message can be fine-tuned based on big data collected, and deliver a more personal message right to their constituents. Finally, data science is used in geospatial analysis by making conclusions about patterns of human behavior around settlement distributions and other factors. For example, geospatial analysis can work together with data science in order to make predictions about why humans settle in certain areas over others, and how to best serve the humans in these settlements, especially in lower-income countries. One application of geospatial analysis and data science is wildfire prevention, where data from forests and subsequent models can be applied to settlements to find where the most likely areas are that wildfires can stem from, and how to best counteract this. Finally, geospatial analysis and data science can improve the human experience by monitoring climate change, and its effects on settlements such as meteorology and vegetation. As a result of this analysis, scientists can determine how to best effectively manage climate change in these settlements, improving the human condition.

Unfortunately, there are downsides to the use of data science and obstacles that prevent the human experience from only being improved with no consequences. While the collection of data on an individual’s consumption can lead to more efficient advertising, client acquisition, and retention, there is a risk that the data can be exploited if it falls into the wrong hands, especially since all of your personal data is a big target for hackers. Moreover, accepting big data’s advantages also means recognizing you are losing a significant amount of privacy to corporations, especially if you didn’t explicitly consent or knew about the extent to which your data is being collected. Another pitfall of data science is that data could be manipulated by politicians in order to ensure that they get more votes, regardless of whether they are being completely honest. For example, a candidate could use big data and use a certain message to target one demographic, and a totally different message to target another demographic. This eliminates the need for a candidate to have a strong and unifying message across voters when candidates had to address everybody, as now hey can essentially present themselves as different candidates to different voters. While a benefit is that big data does allow a more personal message to be delivered, that can also be interpreted as a loophole for politicians to mislead the public.

It is important to note that data science has significantly improved the human experience as it enables technology to better serve humans. Responses as a result of data science can be found in targeting individual consumption in the market, and analysis of human settlements from a geospatial perspective. As governments seek out ways to combat climate change, data science can be seen as one of the leading fields in this endeavor. While big data does serve as a security and privacy risk for individuals, the benefits of embracing data science will vastly improve the human experience overall, especially in our understanding of complex adaptive, economic, and social systems.
