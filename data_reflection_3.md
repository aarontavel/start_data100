FiveThirtyEight’s Presidential Forcast Method

As the 2020 election approaches, various websites have sought to accurately predict the results before November 3. FiveThirtyEight, a reputable website that utilizes statistics to make predictions in politics and sports, released their data-science based method, the 2020 Presidential Forecast, in August of 2020. Nate Silver, the creator of FiveThirtyEight, believes that his model for predicting the presidency did a good job in 2016, despite only giving President Trump approximately a 30% chance of winning. In response to changing circumstances, Silver changed his forecast model to reflect 2020, which as of now, gives President Trump a 13% chance of being reelected.

Silver’s model has changed by taking into consideration, economics as a result of COVID-19, as well as the volume of news every day, which in turn has an effect on voters. Moreover, FiveThirtyEight has placed a higher emphasis on its economic index since the economy is volatile right now, and is presumed to be doing much better before November than when the model was initially released. Finally, turn-out is unpredictable as a result of COVID-19, and mail-in voting will also provide an unpredictable effect, thus, the model seeks to mitigate these uncertainties. What has stayed consistent in Silver’s model are his three steps for determining the forecast of the election.

Nate Silver’s method’s first step, to “collect, analyze, and adjust polls,” is used in helping to calculate the outcome of the election (Silver, 2020). Silver clarifies that polls are not selected arbitrarily when making a conclusion, rather their pollster rating and the sample size is considered when weighing polls differently. The polling averages created come from either a weighted average method or a trend-line method; the latter is usually used closer to election day since it is more “aggressive” (Silver, 2020). Furthermore, Silver’s method has each poll adjusted with a likely-voter adjustment, house-effects adjustment, and a timeline adjustment.

In addition, the second step used by Silver is to “combine polls with ‘fundamentals’ such as demographic and economic data” (Silver, 2020). The method used to create the forecast generates an “enhanced snapshot” to capture the current conditions and voting patterns among all the states. The incumbency effect and economic conditions are also factored into the snapshot in order to accurately predict the election. Finally, The Partisan Lean Index, which considers how a state voted in 2012 and 2016, is taken into account. The Index also relies on the home state of the Presidential/Vice-Presidential nominees, the voting elasticity of states, and the Cost of Voting Index. Finally, Silver’s second step utilizes a rigid method, a demographic regression method, and a regional regression method when applying the Partisan Lean Index.

The final step in Silver’s method is to “account for uncertainty and simulate the election thousands of times” (Silver, 2020). Silver emphasizes this step in his method for calculating the Presidential Forecast because even though Biden is up in the polls, it is hard to translate that into a percentage of winning the election due to uncertainty. As thus, Silver takes into consideration four types of uncertainty in his model, “national drift, national elections day error, correlated state error, and state-specific error” (Silver, 2020). These four uncertainties are all components of an uncertainty index used by the Presidential Forecast. As a result of uncertainty, Silver’s method runs 40,000 simulations every time the model is updated, which is usually daily.
