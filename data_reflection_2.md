FiveThirtyEight’s RAPTOR Method

Before 2013, the NBA did not have official player tracking statistics available to the public. However, upon the availability of these new statistics, in 2019, FiveThirtyEight was able to create RAPTOR. FiveThirtyEight is most known for their political predictions for major elections, however, their creation, RAPTOR, (**R**obust **A**lgorithm [using] **P**layer **T**racking [and] **O**n/Off **R**atings), is a metric used for condensing the data provided by the NBA into something easier to analyze by normal people. Despite RAPTOR being considered only to be a descriptive statistic for data before 2019, for present-data, RAPTOR utilizes the individual player tracking statistics provided by the NBA in order to provide a modern and more accurate description of NBA players from the same perspective of “how modern NBA teams actually evaluate players” (Silver, 2019).

NBA teams typically evaluate a player based on their floor spacing, defense, and shot creation, three skills that were generally ignored by most methods for analyzing players. However, RAPTOR takes those statistics and outputs an offensive and defensive RAPTOR rating which shows “the number of points a player contributes to his team’s offense and defense per 100 possesions, relative to a league-average player” (Silver, 2019). An offensive RAPTOR score of +3.6 indicates that the player helped contribute to his team 3.6 points for 100 offensive possessions while an active player. Similarly, a defensive RAPTOR score of +3.6 indicates that the player helped contribute to his team 3.6 points for 100 defensive possessions while an active player. However, Silver does concede that RAPTOR is unable to take into account “coaching, systems, or synergies between teammates” when creating the RAPTOR scores since RAPTOR is mainly based on math(Silver, 2019).

In RAPTOR’s methodology, a “box” component is used where the individual statistics of a player are utilized, as well as an “on-off” component which describes how a team performs when a player is active and inactive during a large group of possessions. Moreover, RAPTOR is based on a previous data-science method, BPM, where a regression line is used with an independent variable of the “box component” and the “on-off” component as the dependent variable. Utilizing this framework allows RAPTOR to differentiate between a player who is naturally very good or an ok player who is on a very good team.
